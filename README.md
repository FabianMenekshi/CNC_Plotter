e# CNC Plotter with Arduino UNO & CNC SHIELD and 3D printed parts

## Some words on the project:
1. This project has a relatively low cost and can produce some very detailed drawings. It can be used to create t-shirts, cake decorations, drawings, wedding invitations, birthday Christmas cards and anything else you can think of. :)
2. This project was done for the Albanian Science and Engineering Fair 2021 (for the v1.0) and the Albanian Science and Engineering Fair 2023 (for the v2.0). I participated in the Robotics category of this competition, getting Gold Medals both times.
3. This repository is adequate for both the v1.0 and the v2.0 versions of the CNC Plotter.

■ Wooden panel to mount project at least 36x42cm

■ Nuts, bolts and screws needed:
  1. M5 x 25mm (x2)
